## Real estate valuation. 
### Case, based on the real data. 
An investment company bought 20 one-room apartments in a residential complex when the complex was under construction. The apartments with a fit out of economy class were transferred to the company upon completion of the construction. Now these apartments are equipped with necessary furniture and equipment and rented out to individuals on market terms. The company is going to sell out the portfolio by at 31.12.2021  Assume that: 
•	the complex is located in Moscow, Lavochkina street, 34, 
•	an apparent total area is 37.8 square meters, including a living room (18.9 square meters), a kitchen (7.4 square meters), toilet (3.6 square meters).  There is a balcony (2.3 square meters not included in 37.8), 
•	the apartments are located at 4-9 floors, 
•	operating expenses (including utilities, fit out and furniture renovation, property tax) are paid by the owner are estimated at 20% of rent, 
•	average occupancy for the portfolio is 95% (or vacancy is 5%), 
•	cost of the apartments’ sale is 5% of the total sale proceeds. 
Estimate investment value of the asset (portfolio of 20 apartments) as of 01.11.2020.  
The investment value should be defined as the Net Present Value (at 01.11.2020) of cash flows, which the company will receive until the sale of the apartments plus the apartments’ sale proceeds less cost to sell.  
Assume the sale price is equal to the current market price.  
Rental rent should be taken at market level. You may use www.cian.ru as well as other public databases as a source of appropriated comparable offers to estimate market rent and sale price.  
To derive the rent and sale price as of 01.11.2020 for the apartments select at least 4 comparables which have been offered during November 2020.   
You should adjust appropriately differences in characteristics of subject apartments and comparables. Comparables on the first and last floors should not be used. 
Consider the following characteristics: 
•	rights to be transferred (lease/ownership),  
•	time of the deal/offer 
•	location (district of the city),  
•	proximity to metro station,  
•	number of rooms,  
•	apartment size,  
•	floor,  
•	fit out condition. 
 
Adjustments are to be applied by the following formula 
(Price of a comparable) X (1-Adjustment) 
► Adjustment for time of the deal/offer 
► Generally should be based on analytics on deal prices dynamics (http://www.irn.ru/gd/)  
► Adjustment for Location (district of the city) 
► May be based on analytics or estimated as a ratio of average prices for selected samples with similar characteristics except for location (http://www.irn.ru/rating/moscow/) or similar data. 
► Adjustment for Proximity to metro station 
► Develop a linear regression mode to estimate the function Price=F(Proximity to metro station ). Properties for the sample should be carefully selected and have minimal deviation in their characteristics except for proximity to a metro station adjustment to comparable price is defined as 
1-F(Proximity to metro station subject) / F(Proximity to metro station comparable) 
► Adjustment for Apartment size 
► Similar to the Adjustment for Proximity to metro station 
► Adjustment for fit out condition 
► Preferably should be based on appropriate analytics 
Market price or rent should be defined as arithmetical average of adjusted prices of comparables. 
Fit out condition (other characteristics should be similar) 	Adjustment 
Made “euro” fit out 	1.068 
Made “cosmetic” fit out 	1.022 
Repair is not required 	1.000 
Requires “cosmetic” repair 	0.963 
Requires significant repair 	0.924 
You should forecast schedule of sale of the apartments and take into account forecast for market price change (use analytic reports for apartments).   
Discount rate for the cash flows assume at 15%. 
Further requirements: 
The case is prepared in already formed teams. Your presentations and discussion of this Case will be on 19.11.20, 21.11.20 depending on the group you belong to. 
1.	Present all your calculations in clear (understandable) Excel. 
2.	Prepare the analytical report in Word. The analytical report should contain a detailed description of your analysis and calculations. Please, do not forget about the literature, articles and Internet sources that you have used. Make references! 
3.	Prepare the presentation in Power Point (7-10 slides). The last slide should contain the information about each group member contribution. Make sure that your slides reflect your goal, assumptions, logic, findings, and how the NOI, rental rates, prices etc. are calculated and clear conclusion! 
All team members have to attend the seminar and take part in the discussion. Those students that do not attend the presentation without a respectful reason will get zero.  
All materials (1-3) should be sent to your teacher’s e-mail the day before your presentations (till 24-00). 
You will have limited time for your presentation – 15 minutes. Please, be sure that you will be able to present all important things during your presentation!  
Good Luck!
